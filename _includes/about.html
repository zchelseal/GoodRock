                  Waterloo with a passion for solving interesting problems.</p>
                <P>My most recent internships were with the Equity Portfolio Trading desk and
                  Retail Block Trading desk at CIBC Global Markets, optimizing
                  block trade workflows and index research using C#, python, and SQL. </p>
                <P>Some exciting things I'm working on are spearheading organizing the <a href="http://www.bayesiancasecompetition.com/">
                    Bayesian Case Comeptition</a>  (Canada's first student-led case competition on risk management) and 
                    practicing coding through the <a href="https://foobar.withgoogle.com/"> Google FooBar Coding challenge</a> (level 3/5).</p>
